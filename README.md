# stock-analysis
## Overview of Project
The purpose of this project is to analyze a complete set of data that will allow a client to know if it is feasible or not to invest in the stock market to buy shares and for this we have created a code to summarize the information, which is much more easy to analyze.

## Results
In my case the original code, the one that is not refactored, took almost 10 times longer to execute for both years, as an example we will take the year 2018 when with the original code it took 0.34375 seconds to execute.

And this is the result with the refactored code: it took only 0.054 seconds

So, in general terms we can say that refactoring the code shows a big difference between the execution times of the code; which is also visible when coding, since we can see a much more compact code, easy to understand and modify.

This is my refactored code:

## Summary

### Advantages and disadvantages of refactoring code

Personally, I believe that the main advantage of refactoring the code is the time we save when analyzing it, that is, if we want to modify or fix it, we can easily reach the necessary line without much effort, in addition to the fact that the code is executed in a much more efficient way. fast; This is not appreciable when the code is small, but in large projects that often take months of work to execute if we are going to notice a big difference. The disadvantage of refactoring the code is that we can make mistakes and instead of organizing the code we can break it and create new bugs.

### Advantages and disadvantages of the original and refactored VBA script

The biggest advantage of the vba script is that we can do things that perhaps could not be done in the common way in excel and once you have experience and the right knowledge, the tasks can be executed faster and without errors.
The biggest disadvantage is that the progress of our project can be lost, so we must always have a backup of our code.
